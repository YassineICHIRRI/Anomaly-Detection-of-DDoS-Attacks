# Anomaly-Detection-of-DDoS-Attacks
As part of my internship at YaneCode Digital, I'm working on a project takling anomaly detection in computer network where I focuse on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, aiming to identify unusual patterns and activities that deviate significantly from normal behavior within a network or system.

For this project, I am collecting network traffic data and logs from various sources. I then preprocess and transform the raw data to prepare it for analysis. Through exploratory data analysis, I gain insights into normal network behavior and identify potential features for distinguishing normal from anomalous traffic.
